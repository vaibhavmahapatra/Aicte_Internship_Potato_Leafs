### AICTE Internship: Potato Leaf Disease Detection  

Potato leaf diseases, such as early blight and late blight, can severely affect crop yield and quality. Early detection is essential for effective management and protection of potato crops.  

## Methodology  

- **Data Collection**: A dataset containing images of both healthy and diseased potato leaves is gathered from sources like Kaggle.  
- **Preprocessing**: The images undergo preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance consistency and increase dataset diversity.  
- **CNN Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed and trained to classify leaf images accurately.  
- **Training**: The model is trained using a dataset split of 70% for training and 30% for testing. Techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation are employed to improve performance.  
- **Testing and Validation**: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure accuracy, ensuring reliable classification of healthy and diseased leaves.  

## Results and Benefits  

Research shows that CNN models can achieve high accuracy, with some exceeding 90% in detecting potato leaf diseases. This automated detection system assists farmers in taking timely action, reducing disease impact, and optimizing agricultural productivity.  

- **Early Detection**: Facilitates the timely identification of diseases, enabling swift intervention.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimizes manual inspection efforts and reduces crop losses.  
- **Scalability**: Can be effectively implemented in large-scale agricultural operations.
